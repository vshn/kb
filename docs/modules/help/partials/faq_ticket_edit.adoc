=== When's VSHN notified when I create a new ticket?

VSHNeers are notified immediately of the creation of new tickets. Higher priority tickets trigger additional internal alert systems for a faster response.

=== What happens after I submit a new ticket?

Depending on the priority of the ticket and your support SLA, one or many of the following might happen:

* Very often VSHNeers will add comments to the ticket, asking for more information or requesting for your feedback. You will be notified by e-mail of these comments, and you can see the history of conversations in the VSHN Portal.

=== How can I add secrets (passwords, keys, etc.) to tickets?

To communicate secrets to VSHNeers with a secure mechanism, follow these steps:

. After creating a new ticket, click on it on the list of tickets, and scroll down until the section "Secrets" is visible.
. Click on the btn:[Add Secret] button.
. Enter a name for the secret in the **Name** field.
. Enter the value of the secret in the **Secret** field.
. Select "Week" or "Day" in the **Time to live (TTL)** field. 
. Click on the btn:[Save] button.

The VSHN Portal is designed in such a way that secrets transmitted through this mechanism can only be viewed once, which prevents anyone else from accessing them.
